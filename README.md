# Multilingual Semantic Search + RAG
This project is a *multilingual search engine* that lets you ask a question in one language (English, Hindi, French, or Spanish) and find relevant documents in multiple other languages.
It then uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to give you a clear, AI-generated answer based on the documents it finds.

# Features
1.Search in Any Supported Language – Find documents across languages.
2.Fast Vector Search – Uses FAISS to quickly find the most relevant results.
3.Smart Answers – Uses TinyLLaMA to give short, accurate answers from search results.
4.Automatic Translation – Uses NLLB-200 so results are in the language you asked.
5.Easy to Use Interface – Built with Gradio.
